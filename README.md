# ResearchPaperLaTeXTemplate - An easy-to-use LaTeX template for writing formal research papers.

#### TL;DR; This project would be useful to you if you know basic LaTeX but properly structuring a formal paper is difficult or tiring.

## Usage

Clone this project into your computer.

If using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) (and you should because its the GOAT for cloud-based TeX compilation) or any other cloud-based TeX platforms like [Papeeria](https://www.papeeria.com), [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com) (now a part of **Overleaf**).
  - Upload the whole cloned directory to that service.
  - That's it! Start writing the paper.

Otherwise:
  - Ensure you have some TeX distribution (like TeX Live, MikTex, MacTex, etc) installed on your computer.
  - Some of the packages used in this template may not already be installed on your device.
  - To install new packages, follow the [adding new packages to latex](https://scholar.princeton.edu/scuellar/blog/2014/02/adding-new-packages-latex) guide.
  - Use the `main.tex` as the entry point and compile.
  - That's it! Start writing the paper.
